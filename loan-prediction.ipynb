However, both existing and new methods of measuring completion have limitations.\n\n### For institutions primarily following an academic year calendar system, the IPEDS completion rates are limited to full-time, first-time students beginning in the fall semester. For institutions primarily following a non-academic year calendar system (program or continuous enrollment), the IPEDS completion rates cover all full-time, and first-time students. The exclusion of part-time students, transfer students, and students who do not start during the fall from IPEDS completion rates makes the rates less relevant for those populations of students.\n\n### IPEDS data have several important limitations for measuring institutional performance. Perhaps the most significant is that many outcomes are recorded for a limited subset of students. Most importantly, graduation rates are only reported for cohorts of full-time, first-time students, so graduation rate information is not available for students who may have previous higher education experience or for               part-time students. Another limitation is that outcomes are not recorded for students who transfer from the institution. Thus, information on graduation rate outcomes is limited.\n\n### Cohort graduation rates are for full-time, first-time students. This is the official measure of graduation rates mandated by the Higher Education Act, measuring the fraction of full-time, first-time students who complete their program of study within 100, 150, or 200 percent of the ‘normal’ completion time—e.g., the 150 percent completion rate measures the fraction of the cohort that graduates within six years for students pursuing a four-year degree or three years for students pursuing a two-year degree.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print ('200% Completion rate for 4 years degree according to different percentages')\nprint

For other case, if we take a combination of all the rates, it will give us a better picture.
